Now that we've built a basic router, the next step is to learn how to interact with a MySQL database.
Creating a Database

You can create a database directly from the terminal:

mysql -u root
CREATE DATABASE myapp;
(CREATE DATABASE simpleBlog;)

Alternatively, use a GUI like TablePlus to create and manage your database visually. Connect to localhost on port 3306 with user root and no password (for local development).
Creating a Table

Within your database, create a table for blog posts. Think of a table like an Excel spreadsheet or a web form.

Common columns might include:

    id (primary key, auto-incrementing)
    title (e.g., VARCHAR(255), not nullable)

Example column definition:

    Name: title
    Type: VARCHAR(255)
    Nullable: No
    Default: None

Save the table to persist the structure.
Adding Data

Insert records into your table. The id will auto-increment:
id 	title
1 	My first blog post
2 	My second blog post
Relational Databases

In real applications, you might add more columns like post body, status (draft, published), and relationships to other tables, such as a users table to track authorship.

This linking of tables is what makes a database relational.

Basic SQL Queries

To select all records from the posts table:

SELECT * FROM posts;

You can also select specific columns:

SELECT id FROM posts;
SELECT title FROM posts;
SELECT id, title FROM posts;

Add a WHERE clause to filter results:

SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = 1;

if you work from simple `php -S localhost:8080` the `#dsn` must be
$dsn = 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;port=3306;dbname=YOUR_DB_NAME;charset=utf8mb4';
